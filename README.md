### ***Overview***

this is a simple text encoder/decoder, built entirely from scratch by dinguschan! this project will not be getting constant updates, as I have pushed the final update, but if you have a request just add an issue on the repo :D

### ***Download Instructions***

hit the "Code" button on this repo, then download the .ZIP and extract all, then open the .HTML file to use the project.

### ***Usage Instructions***

is there a brain in that head or is it just for decoration? just visit the website i linked, or download it from the page ur on _right now_, then open the html file and follow the conviently placed and beautifully styled on screen instructions. seriously dude, this shits so simple a kindergartner could do it. one last note, downloading it as a file works the best, then official the Vercel page. Vercel has problems loading external CDNs which i use, namely FontAwesome, so expect some visual issues (itl be kinda ugly but will still function the same) if you use this link or host it urself.
